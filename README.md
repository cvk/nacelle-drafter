## What is Nacelle Drafter trying to solve?

### 1. A new approach to avoiding distraction
Most "focus-enhancing" software works by silencing notifications and removing distractions. Nacelle Drafter is different. Using **auditory and visual feedback**, it propels your writing with the challenge of maintaining a "warp drive." 

- **Calm, steady input** ensures you experience a pleasing warp speed, with background stars streaming by
- This "methalox-focus-typing" (m-foc-typing) creates a touch of additional engagement to mentally overwrite distractions and immerse you in the stellar flow. Methalox is a type of rocket fuel. üòé

*Note:* The warp drive and auditory settings may require further customization to suit individual preferences. **Currently only via code.**

### 2. Simplified printing
Often, the last thing I do as I leave my desk is send some prose to the printer for **annotation** the next morning with a red ballpoint and some coffee ‚òïÔ∏è. While my editing software certainly allows me to print with **EXTRA MARGINS** and **INCREASED LINE BREAKS**, I really don't want to be fussing with settings and profiles for printing as I leave my desk. 

- **Nacelle Drafter simplifies this step:**  
 Paste a block of text, click the Nacelle Drafter print icon, return to cruising speed.  
 *Standard Print Menu functions will show a blank page! Use the on-screen icon.*
